Imagine a feature where you can configure a sports team in a declarative manner. The team has a few attributes like team name, color,
and players.

[source,yml]
.src/main/resources/application.yml
----
include::{sourceDir}/src/main/resources/application.yml[tag=teamConfig]
----

With Micronaut we can use the `@ConfigurationProperties` annotation to slurp the configuration into a bean. Each property that matches
the configuration in the `application.yml` will call the setter in the bean. The bean will be subsequently available for injection in the application!

[source,kotlin]
.src/main/kotlin/example/micronaut/TeamConfiguration.kt

include::{sourceDir}/src/main/kotlin/example/micronaut/TeamConfiguration.kt[tag=teamConfigClassNoBuilder]
