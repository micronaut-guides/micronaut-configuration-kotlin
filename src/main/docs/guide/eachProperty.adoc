Micronaut is also able to read a "list" of configurations that are related. Imagine we would like to declare stadiums and their
attributes.

[source,yml]
.src/main/resources/application.yml
----
include::{sourceDir}/src/main/resources/application.yml[tag=stadiumConfig]
----

<1> This element will be the name of the bean.

We can use `@EachProperty` which will cycle through the configuration and read each nested clause as a bean. The higher level
property will be parameterized as the name.

[source,kotlin]
.src/main/kotlin/example/micronaut/StadiumConfiguration.kt
----
include::{sourceDir}/src/main/kotlin/example/micronaut/StadiumConfiguration.kt[]
----

<1> Establish the top layer of configuration
<2> `name` is read in from the property key and send as a parameter to the bean.
